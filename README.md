# Full Vehicle Statistics Analysis

This Jupyter Notebook provides a comprehensive analysis of passenger vehicle statistics by processing and exploring data from `.csv` files.

## Features
- **Data Loading**: Reads and concatenates multiple `.csv` files from a specified directory.
- **Data Exploration**: Includes descriptive statistics, data type information, and basic summaries of the dataset.
- **Visualization and Insights**: (Assumed further analysis and visualizations based on cell structure).

## Dependencies
The notebook requires the following Python packages:
- `pandas` (for data manipulation and analysis)
- `os` (for file path operations)

Ensure you have these packages installed before running the notebook.

## Usage
1. Place your `.csv` files in a directory named `PassengerVehicle_Stats` relative to the notebook file.
2. Open the notebook and run the cells sequentially to process and analyze the data.
3. View summary statistics and explore additional insights provided by the notebook.

## Structure
- **Data Loading**: The notebook reads data from all `.csv` files in the `PassengerVehicle_Stats` directory.
- **Data Cleaning and Exploration**: Provides methods to inspect and summarize the data (`info`, `describe`, `dtypes`).
- **Further Analysis**: Additional code cells may include data transformations and visualizations.

## Notes
- Ensure that all `.csv` files are correctly formatted and consistent in structure.
- Modify the `file_path` variable in the notebook if using a different directory.
